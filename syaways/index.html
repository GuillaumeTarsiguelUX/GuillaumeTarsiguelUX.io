					<h3 class="project_step-title">Defining</h3>
					<p class="project_step-content">After reviewing the client brief with them, our team recapped the technical constraints and plotted the differents steps we would need to conduct in our UX process. We built a 2-month retro-planning and used it to share the tasks between ourselves.</p>

					<section class="project_substep">
						<h4 class="project_substep-title">From secondary sources</h4>
						<p class="project_substep-content">
							I gathered various studies covering topics relevant to our subject, such as millenial demographics, online booking, or traveling habits in Europe. To further ensure the reliability of the data, I only picked recent studies (mostly from the current or previous year) carried out by recognised source (e.g. Phocus Wright, Expedia, KPMG). I went through those 14 studies and synthesised the most relevant figures in order to get a broad impression of our marker and our users. This first quantitative data would help us narrow the rest of our user research, towards more qualitative data.

				<section class="subsection">
						<h4 class="project_substep-title">From primary sources, i.e. the users themselves</h4>
						<p class="project_substep-content">
							The preceding user research phase I lead gave me the main characteristics of our users and our market. Now, in order to gather more relevant and qualitative data, I redacted an online Google Form survey, more centered on Syaways service. I reviewed this survey with the other team members, removing any bias or ambiguity to ensure the accuracy of the data I would gather. After I got enough respondents, I used a data analysis software called Tableau Public to analyze the survey result and build two user profiles that would be used as the draft of our persona.

							<figcaption>Fig.4 — Personna drafts built after data analysis</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p class="project_substep-content">
							We interviewed users about their booking and traveling habits in order to better know them with precise opinions and verbatims. (not me / direct insights). Also We tested the users on concurrent websites  in order to see the dos and the don’ts.
							The other team members and I summarized our user research data into two personas : Anna and Carl . Theses personas would allow to empathize with the user during the conception phase. We also built an experience map for each persona, in order to spot where our product could improve their travel experience.
						</p>

						<figure class="project_step-artifact">
							<img src="todo.png">
							<figcaption>Fig.5 — Personna and experience maps of our users</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>
							We quickly identified <strong>how stressful would be the buying process</strong>.  One of the reason why is that, because of technical constraints, Syaways would not yet internalize the ticket-buying step in its platform — meaning users might have to go buy tickets onto separate airline websites.</p>
						<p>Our user research showed me that booking a trip online is a really <strong>task-oriented action</strong>. So, with feedbacks from the client, I wrote a “Job to be done”, which is a one sentence résumé of what the user wants to accomplish and in what context. It is a powerful tool when designing task-oriented interfaces such as Syaways’. Indeed, during the design phase,it will help us remember the different goals our product should meet : functional, social, and emotional.

				<section class="subsection">
					<h3 class="project_step-title">Ideation</h3>
					<p class="project_step-content">Having built our personas, experience maps and Job to be done, we were able to <strong>make people empathize</strong> with our users and their goals. From there, I leaded several ideation workshops called Crazy Eight, with the client team and potential users, to generate a maximum of ideas and to nurture our creativity.</p>

						<figcaption>Fig.7 — First step of ideation : quantity, with the Crazy Eight workshop</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p class="project_step-content">We had lots of crazy ideas, now we needed to sort them out. So during a workshop with the client, we reviewed these ideas, and then I lead a Crzay Eight alternative workshop : this time, participants should come up with more realistic and applicable ideas in the light of our Job to be done, our personas and our experiences maps. This served as the preparation for our first prototypes.

				<section class="subsection">
					<h3 class="project_step-title">Design and test iterations</h3>
					<p>I used our persona’s experience maps to write a standard scenario of a user booking a trip online. Containing context and detailed directives, this scenario can be used as a protocol for prototype testing. The protocol is clear and robust, so it can collect consistent and comparable data throughout all range of prototypes, from low to high fidelity. Also, even after the project is complete, other UX designers will be able to use this protocol to test further improvements in the future.</p>
					<p>After gathering the data from our co-conception workshops, I created low-fidelity paper wireframes, in order to quickly iterate with my team through website structure options and usability issues. Thanks to this step, we decided for a one-page structure with inner tabs and a very guided check-out process.

					<p class="project_step-content">Our interface depends a lot on visuals, in terms of illustration and cognitive psychology (see <a class="clickable-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping">Gestalt laws</a>) , so we decided to test a high-fidelity mockupon our users. This helped us improve the organisation of the filters and simplify the check-out pop-up.

				<h2 id="project_conclusion-title">Results and learnings</h2>



					<p>The final user tests of the high-fidelity mock-up turned out OK, with a great success rate and understanding of the specificity of Syaways’ new algorithm.</p>
					<p> Due to technical constraints, the check-out process was unfortunately still a big stressful bottleneck for users, despite all the efforts we put to make it the smoothest and most reassuring possible. Internalizing the check-out process was our number 1 recommendation for Syaways.</p>
					<p>As of October 2018, Syaways'website is live and running (beta version)! If you are looking for a different way of booking flights, make sure to have a look : <a href="wwww.syaways.com" class="clickable-link">www.syaways.com</a>  🚀</p>
				

				<section class="subsection" id="project_conclusion-challenges_and_learnings">
					<h3>Some thoughts and key learnings</h3>
					<ul class="listwrapper">
						<li class="li-good_stuff"><p>Conducting workshops with creative people was real fun, especially when it comes to roleplaying and empathizing with our users, really coming to understand them, and finding the right ideas that they would appreciate</p></li>
						<li class="li-good_stuff"><p> I’m glad I focused on conducting a thorough and reliable user research as it was a great help for all the following steps of our design process.</p></li>
						<li class="li-challenge_stuff"><p>The biggest challenge of this mission was time ; we had a 2-month deadline for a school-like project, meaning we still had full time jobs on the meantime ! Moreover, interactions with the users (interviews, surveys, tests) take an incompressible amount of time, and can not be rushed ; in order to have enough relevant data, planning is mandatory.</p></li>
						<li class="li-challenge_stuff"><p>The work with the team also had its obstacles, as we all had different working habits, regarding communications channels (Slack, Facebook, texts, Google Drive, OneDrive), writing and prototyping softwares (Axure, Adobe XD, Sketch), and even operating systems  ! Surely this added friction and redundancy in the process, as we did not take the time to learn other softwares just for this mission. It eventually turned out OK because we were aware of this issue and hence we carefully split the tasks.</p></li>
						<li class="li-interesting_stuff"><p>
						During the observation phase of our user research, I was surprised to see how much travelers didn’t like chatbot during their online booking… That’s why we didn’t use any, even if I initially thought of this idea. It was also interesting to see how small is the mobile usage during a booking process, and how stressful this process is for the user !</p></li>
						<li class="li-interesting_stuff"><p>Teamwork is crucial, everyone in the team had its strengths and it was essential to use them</p></li>
						<li class="li-love_stuff"><p>
						It was great having the opportunity to conduct a complete UX process, from the client brief to the high-fidelity prototype ready to be implemented. An overall very rewarding challenge !</p></li>
